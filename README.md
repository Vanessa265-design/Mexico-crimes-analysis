### Project Overview
---
This project is intended to explore and analyze the crimes that have been registered by the Government of Mexico.

The programming language used through the analysis was python in Visual Studio Code. 

During the analysis, I will try to get answer the following questions, which might be reassessed depending of the results and relevancy.
1. Which years does the dataframe contain?
2. What is the most registered 'type of crime'?
3. Which is the most registered 'subtype of crime'?
4. From the two questions above, which 'Entity' has more cases being registered? 
5. What is their ocurrence throughout the years?


### Data Source
---
The database was obtained from an Official Mexico Government Website. For more information around: https://www.gob.mx/sesnsp/acciones-y-programas/datos-abiertos-de-incidencia-delictiva. 

I do not own any of the data, this are official figures given by the Mexican government.


### Data Cleaning
---
Understand data population and exclude any duplicated data, evaluate the deletion of empty (NaN) rows or columns that may impact or affect the accuracy of our conclusions, including erroneous data.

The dataframe contains 332,416 rows and the following columns: 
- year
- entity_code
- entity
- affected_legal_good
- type_of_crime
- subtype_of_crime
- modality
- month
- count
